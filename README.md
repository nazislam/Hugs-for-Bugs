# Hugs-for-Bugs

In order to run the application:

1. First, install Node from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) website.
2. Clone the repository by `git clone https://github.com/nazislam/Hugs-for-Bugs.git`

3. Navigate to the directory and open a terminal and do `npm install`. This will install the dependancies for the backend (Express) of the application.

4. Navigate to client directory and do `npm install` to install the Angular dependencies.

Once all the dependencies are installed, run the server.

RUNNING THE SERVER:

In terminal, navigate to the root project folder (where `app.js` and `package.json` exist) and do `npm start`. This will run the run express backend on port `3000`.

Once the backend server is running, navigate to client directory and do `npm start`, which will open the server in browser on port `4200`.

Once the serve is running, access it `http://localhost:4200`.
